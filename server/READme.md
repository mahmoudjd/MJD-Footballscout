## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mahmoudjd/abschlussarbeit.git
  cd server
  pnpm install
```
### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the `server/` folder with the following variables:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```
> Ensure your MongoDB server is running before proceeding.

### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
   pnpm dev
```
---

## 🐳 Running the Server with Docker

### 1. Build the Docker Image
```bash
  docker build -t backend-server
```

### 2. Run the Docker Container

```bash
  docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env backend-server
```

## 🔐 API Endpoints

### Authentication:
- **POST /auth/register** → Create a new user
- **POST /auth/login** → Authenticate a user and generate a JWT token

### Players:
- **GET /players** → Fetch all players
- **POST /players** → Add a new player (authentication required)
- **PUT /players/:id** → Update an existing player (authentication required)
- **DELETE /players/:id** → Delete a player (authentication required)

> Note: Most routes require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
